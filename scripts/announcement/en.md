## Prevention and Protection Strategy

1. **Every participant should fill out the Personal Health Declaration Form.** After filling out the form, you will get your personal QR-Code that will allow you to attend our physical events. The information you provide is only saved in case of any emergency contact needed. Please be sure to save the QRCode carefully as it cannot be retreive again after lost. If you lost your QRCode, the only way you can do is to fill out the form again. (The Personal Health Declaration Form will be open for review on July 20, 2020 and open for submission on July 30, 2020. If you have any concern about The Personal Health Declaration Form, be free to contact us for any suggestions.) If you cannot fill the form with any electrical device on the day of the event, we will provide you with printed form. Please hand it over to us after filling it.
2. According to the CECC, a social distance of 1.5 meters(indoor) and 1 meter(outdoor) shall be maintained, and people are urged to wear facemasks in crowded and cofined spaces. **Every participant shall keep their facemask on during our events.**
3. **The contact-information-based measures will be implemented in our physical events**. Participants shall receive badges at checkin counter with the QRCode you get after filling out The Personal Health Declaration Form. Only those who have badges can enter our event buildings. You will have to wear the badge when you enter AU conference hall, passing the entrance of TR Building at 1F, and RB105 conference room. Please be sure to checkin and get your badges before entering the event buildings.
4. **The number of people is limited in every room.** There will be staff monitoring the number of people in rooms. Please follow the instructions of our staff and not to enter if the room has reached its maximum allowance. We will post QRCode at the entrance of each rooms, providing a way for you to record your footprints during events. You are encouraged to scan the QRCode for faster contact in emergency need.
